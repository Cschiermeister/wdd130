    <p> I am from Vancouver Washington and I have been here in Rexburg for about 3 yeasr now. 
        I just decided to study Software Engneering so this is my first semester doing that. 
        One of my favorite things to do is play Ultimate Frisbee, especially once the cold 
        weather goes away and the wind dies down a bit. The other main thing I do here is rock climb.
        I have been rock climbing off and on for about 4 years and it is definitely one of my favoriite 
        ways to pass the time here during the Winters.</p>
     
     <p> I have been married for about 8 months. This last summer my wife and I worked at a campsite/lakeside lodge 
         in the Sawtoth Mountains called Redfish Lake Lodge which is where I proposed and where the picture of us 
         above was taken. We both worked on the Marina there shuttling hikers across the 5 mile lake and just driving 
         boats all summer.
